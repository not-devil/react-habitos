
## HabitOS

HabitOS is an early-stage behavior design platform focused on helping people build lasting habits and quit harmful ones by redesigning their environment, daily actions, and accountability systems. Unlike traditional habit trackers that rely on motivation and streaks, HabitOS applies first-principles behavioral design to make consistency automatic and sustainable.

This repository contains the initial landing experience and backend foundation used for market validation and early product development.

If you want, I can also:

* Tighten this to a **1-sentence founder pitch**
* Rewrite it for **VC decks**
* Add a **Problem → Solution → Differentiation** README section

Just tell me 👍
